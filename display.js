// Display
// Use classes, attributes, and methods in the JavaScript language for this challenge. Use only a single JavaScript file for this assignment, it may be the same from the Fronts assignment. All examples are done in order, starting with a new instance of the SLL class.

// Create display() that uses a while loop and a runner to return a string containing all list values. Build what you wish console.log(myList) did!

class SLL {
    // constructor, other methods, removed for brevity
    display() {
        // neatly display nodes in my list
    }
}
